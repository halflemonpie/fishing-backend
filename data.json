They move into inshore waters off the U.S. Pacific coast by late summer, then spend late fall and winter in the western Pacific Ocean. The timing and distance of their migrations in a given year depend on oceanic conditions.</li>\n<li>Less is known about the movements of albacore in the South Pacific Ocean – juveniles move southward from the tropics when they are about a foot long, and then eastward to about 130˚ West. When the fish are mature, they return to tropical and subtropical waters to spawn.</li>\n<li>They’re able to reproduce when they reach 5 to 6 years old, and they live for 10 to 12 years.</li>\n<li>North Pacific albacore spawn between March and July in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific.

Depending on their size, females release between 800,000 and 2.6 million eggs every time they spawn.</li>\n<li>Albacore can swim at speeds exceeding 50 miles per hour and cover vast areas during annual migrations.</li>\n<li>They have a highly evolved circulatory system that regulates their body temperature and increases muscle efficiency; a high metabolism; and high blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which increase oxygen absorption.</li>\n<li>They lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water over their gills so, in order to breathe, they must constantly swim with their mouths open.</li>\n<li>Albacore are top carnivores, preying on schooling stocks such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. They eat an enormous amount of food to fuel their high metabolism, sometimes consuming as much as 25 percent of their own weight every day.</li>\n<li>Larger species of billfish, tuna, and sharks eat albacore.</li>\n</ul>\n",
